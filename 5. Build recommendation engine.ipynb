    "## Here we train a 20 topics model on all of the data. The goal is to build a recommendation engine and we do that as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Extract topics distribution per document from the model object. To compute expertise on topics we sum these probabilities up to folder level over all outbox emails (now it may be clear why we removed forward emails texts). Call this value OUT_sum (derived per folder and topic ).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) To compute level s of interest in a topic we first sum over all inbox mails, at folder topic level. Call this column IN_sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) We consider OUT_sum to be a good measure of knowledge on a topic, as it accounts for both the odds that an email is indeed about a topic as well as how often folder owner speaks about this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4) Interest in a topic is (considering recommendation engine as the goal!) is measured by the ration OUT_sum/IN_sum. This measure also accounts for situations where expert talks to other experts, thus needs no mentor there.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) For a mentor and mentee pair of executives (i,j) (ordered pair!) with corresponding values for a topic t, we then compute the following metric\n",
    "\n",
    "#               M(t,i,j):=OUT_sum(i,t)* ((OUT_sum(j,t) + beta)/(IN_sum(j,t) + beta))\n",

    "\n",
    "# M(i,j)=Sum_{i,j} M(t,i,j)\n",
    "\n",
    "### as overall measure of match. This is in fact an inner product and in is high when the mentor and mentee have both high values in many topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our recommendation engine will propose per mentor 3 mentees with maximal values of M(i,.). Choice for 3 is bit arbitrary and implementing in a business would require considering further specifics to come from the stakeholders.\n",

    "# Notice that we match based on expertise  and preference levels as well as interest in receiving mentorship (according to our interpretation) over all topics jointly!!!\n",
    "#### Off course further analysis will yield what the actual topics per pair are that really matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to test this unsupervised engine?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Well a complex machine like  car or plane is not tested by a single test for a good reason. Therefore our model which consists of various steps also need to be addressed in various ways. LDA topics model has already been tested thus we only need to test the method developed here. We propose the following three metrics.\n"

If it is highly unlikely (in the tail) then that obviously votes in favor of our matching system being meaningful.
